Game Overview  :
In "Guess The Number 2," there are two players: a human user and the machine itself. The primary goal of the game is to guess the correct number within a limited number of attempts. The game is divided into six turns, each consisting of specific tasks for both players.

Introduction for New Users  :    
For users new to the game, it starts with a friendly introduction, providing an overview of the game's rules, objectives, and unique features. This introduction ensures that players understand the game mechanics before they begin.

Gameplay  :
1. The human user attempts to guess a number generated by the machine within 10 attempts.
2. The machine guesses a number chosen by the human user within 12 attempts, utilizing a binary search approach to optimize its guesses.
3. The machine generates a random number for the user to guess, with two difficulty levels: easy (1 to 10) and hard (1 to 100), each with a corresponding number of allowed attempts (10).
4. The initial score for both players is 100, and it decreases by 5 for each unsuccessful attempt.

Machine's Binary Search Approach  :
- The machine's strategy for guessing the human user's chosen number involves a binary search algorithm.
- This approach efficiently narrows down the possible range of numbers with each guess, allowing the machine to converge on the correct answer in fewer attempts.

Features  :
1. Dynamic Text Display  : The game provides a more immersive experience by displaying text with a simulated delay, resembling a conversation between the game and the user.
2. Cheating Mechanism  : If the human user cheats in one turn, the machine employs a cheating strategy in the next turn.
3. Exception Handling : The game incorporates robust exception handling to ensure that user input is valid and within the specified range.
4. Exit Option: The user has the flexibility to exit the game at any time by typing "exit" while providing input.

Game Outcome  :
At the end of the six turns, the scores for both the human user and the machine are calculated by combining the scores from each turn. The player with the higher combined score is declared the winner. In the event of a tie, the game ends as a draw.
